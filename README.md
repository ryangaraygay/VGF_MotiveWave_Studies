Custom Indicators I have created for MotiveWave using Java.

I do not recommend or advice which indicators to use, this is for reference only. Nor provide any trading or investment advice.
I only use some of them and there is no magic indicator for successful trading.
With that said, I actively use Price-Delta convergence for strength confirmation (or absence thereof). Along with OrderFlow and PriceAction strategies for scalping or intra-day trades of ES/MES futures.
